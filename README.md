## Project Context
Using all of the skills you’ve developed over the course of the last two trimesters, you’re going to team up with a partner in creating your very own project from start to finish. You’ll develop a design, narrow down what should be in your MVP (minimum viable product), and work together as a team to bring your idea to life. You have a limited number of days to work on this project, so be sure to keep your scope reasonable for you and your team.

## Challenge
There is one rule that must be followed… your application must follow the theme given to you by your instructor. You and your team are free to interpret that in any way you see fit (keep it Safe For Work, though)! It will be fun to see how different everyone’s applications are during the lightning talks at the end of this Hack Sprint!
